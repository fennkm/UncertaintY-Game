# UncertaintY

*Oh, thank god you're here! You're the Chief of Security, right…? We've got a bit of a situation going on if you hadn't already noticed: there's been an unfortunate… incident… in the labs. We've been working on some fascinating research into macroscopic quantum behaviour - really riveting stuff, I tell you - and we had just started to move on to animal testing and... well. Long story short: there's been a breach in containment.*

*We've got god-knows-what running around the labs, and what's worse is they've somehow taken out the main power grid. We managed to rig up an auxiliary generator with just enough juice to access the security camera network. We hooked it up and... nothing. Can't see hide nor hair of the experiments and more worryingly, nor the scientists that had been working on them. Now, Professor Lynn has helpfully informed us that this is due to a peculiar quirk of these test subjects.*

*I'm not an expert on this - I'm with the robotics team for heaven's sake - but it seems these entities are able to arrange their atoms at will to assume the form of any object they want! Naturally, this makes them rather hard to track down. However, I have also been informed that even in this disguised state, the entities still exhibit certain quantum behaviours; the buggers will enter a state of superposition when not directly observed. All you need to know is they will seem to.. errr… "jump around" a bit when you take your eyes off them.*

*That's where you come in. I know I complained when our hard-earned budget was being spent on automated weapons systems for the entire facility, but it seems like now is the perfect time to give the new systems a run for their money. Be careful, though: make every shot count. We only have enough juice for a handful of misfires, and what's worse, if we run out of power and lose the lights, these creatures are going to have full run of the place, completely unobserved. And I don't fancy finding out what happened to the other team members quite yet.*

*We're going to start you off in the Chief Researcher's office, and then have you take a look at one of our robotics labs. We're getting readings all over the place, but they seem particularly strong in these two locations. Now, remember: you're looking for regular objects that seem to move around when you're not looking. Take a good long look and light em up if you see one. Remember, we're draining power by the second, so you're on the clock. Good luck, Chief.*

## Introduction

UncertintY is a hide-and-seek game with a quantum twist! Watch the security cameras carefully and eliminate the mysterious entities before they take over the lab!

This game was made using WebGL with ThreeJS over the course of a month for a university project. Complete with sound effects, spooks, and 2 levels created lovingly using blender. Featuing 3 hand-made assets: book, concical flask, and security camera!
